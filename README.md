## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, and Mongodb

Started with installing my packages, setup my modules by requiring each one. Added middleware to help interpret things such as rendering ejs files for the view. Connected database via Mongodb to store documents, such as tasks added by the user to be edited or deleted. Added models to build schemas provided by mongoose to set requirements for the text inputs. Setup the routes such as root route to render.ejs and data from mongoose and input boxes for deletion addition and editing. Setup Post method, so users can add data. Setup update method, so users can edit data. Setup delete method, so users can delete data, all via mongoose. Finally styled form with css.

## Optimizations
*pending*


## Lessons Learned:
.env file hides confidential information such as MongoURI so documents cannot be accessed.


## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
